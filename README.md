"Great repository names are short and memorable." I mean, seahorse-data-girl kinda nails it.

Please clone this repo and run the jupyter notebook. It'll take a minute and I promise you a smile when you get there.

I very much believe you do, but if you don't know what any of this is... ok, bear with me. You can see how to get and run jupyter lab [here]([url](https://jupyter.org/install)https://jupyter.org/install). After that you might need to run `python -m pip install -r <path-to-this-repo>/requirements.txt`. But then you should be all set.
