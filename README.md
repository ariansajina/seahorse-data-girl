"Great repository names are short and memorable." I mean, seahorse-data-girl kinda nails it.

Please clone this repo and run the jupyter notebook (hey.ipynb). It'll only take a minute and I promise you a smile by the time you get to the end.

You can use JupyterLab to run the noteboook. You might need to run `python -m pip install -r <path-to-this-repo>/requirements.txt` if you're missing any of the python packages.
